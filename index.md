## [Interactive gallery](./mixInteractiveGallery)
  Interactive gallery is a photography exhibition in which the audience is invited to explore the images by moving their hands, as if shedding light on a wall using a flashlight. The live installation used the Kinect device. A browser version is available, which works with mouse positions only.

  In this video, the position of the hands is shown on top-right right corner for illustration purposes, but it is not part of the installation.

## Technical notes
 * One generative art project per folder. 
 * Projects starting with P are [Processing](processing.org) sketches; pyXXX are Python-based, otherwise a combination of techniques & languages.
 

## Notes about Processing sketches
* Data (images, audio, video, JSON etc) used by the sketches in always in the `/data` folder of each Processing sketch.
* The generated image is usually in `/out` folder
