# Technical notes
 * I organized the source code so that there is one generative art project per folder. 
 * Projects starting with P are [Processing](processing.org) sketches; pyXXX are Python-based, otherwise a combination of techniques & languages.
 * In Processing sketches, additional data (images, audio, video, JSON etc) used by the sketches in always in the `/data` folder of each Processing sketch.
 * If the sketch generates some kind of output, it will be placed in `/out` folder. The source code includes one output as example.
