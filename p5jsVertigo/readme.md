# Vertigo

**Vertigo** is a series of generative compositions inspired in the work of [Saul Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass) for the movie covers of Vertigo (1978), directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Saul was the master of movie titles, and the father of "kinect typography", the technique to mix text and animation to express an idea. The elegance and simplicity of Saul's design is still of great influence to movie titles, graphic designs and typography.

 My drawings started as a reproduction of the original Vertigo cover, and later expanded to reproductions of [alternative posters](https://alternativemovieposters.com/portfolio_tags/alfred-hitchcock-director/) as well, named with Roman letters in no particular order.
