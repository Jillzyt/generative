# Vertigo

**Vertigo** is a series of generative compositions inspired on the works of [Saul Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass), in particular the movie covers of Vertigo (1958), directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Saul was the master of movie titles, and the father of "kinect typography", the technique mixing text and animation to express an idea. The elegance and simplicity of Saul's design is still of great influence to movie titles, graphic designs and typography.

 My drawings started as a reproduction of the original Vertigo cover, and later expanded to reproductions of [alternative posters](https://alternativemovieposters.com/portfolio_tags/alfred-hitchcock-director/) as well. The pieces are named with Roman letters in no particular order.

Most of the compositions are published also in OpenProcessing [here](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/543268), which is an easier plaftorm to fiddle with the source code.
